"""Module feretui.response.

It is the response object used by feretui to return any result quering by
the client.

This reponse can not be used directly by web serving. The adapter to connect
the web-serving with this response must be write by another libray or by the
developper.

Example with bottle::

    from bottle import response, route
    from feretui import FeretUI

    myferet = FeretUI()

    @route('/feretui/action/<action>', method=['GET', 'POST'])
    def post_action(action):
        ...
        res = myferet.do_action(frequest, action)
        for k, v in res.headers.items():
            response.set_header(k, v)

        return res.body,
